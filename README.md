# CitySim
A light-hearted and not at all serious attempt at simulating a city.

## Goals
- Quick (within ~10 seconds) generation of a city of 1000 x 1000 tiles
- Some form of GUI (whatever that means...) that shows the people going about their business and provides info about the queried object
- A city has a fixed number of citizens at runtime (no births or deaths)
- Citizens go about their daily business as you'd expect from a real city
- Citizens can use cars or public transport (or walk) to their destinations
